To develop a simplified model to simulate design decision-making processes in small teams competing in a controlled environment, using computational models and a simplified game-theoretic approach.

## Objective
To develop a simplified model to simulate design decision-making processes in small teams competing in a controlled environment, using computational models and a simplified game-theoretic approach.

## Project Components

### Model Development

#### Bayesian Optimization
- **Purpose**: Model the process of optimizing design decisions based on prior decisions and outcomes.
- **Implementation**: Utilize Gaussian Processes to predict and optimize decision outcomes.

#### Sequence Learning
- **Purpose**: Predict future decisions of the teams based on historical data.
- **Technologies**: Implement using Recurrent Neural Networks or Hidden Markov Models.

#### Game Theory
- **Purpose**: Simulate competition between teams using basic game-theoretic models.
- **Details**: Models will include elements of cooperative vs. competitive strategies and their impact on decision-making.

### Simulation Environment

- **Setup**: Develop a computer-based simulation for multiple teams (two to four) to make decisions on design problems.
- **Interface**: A simple user interface will be used for inputting decisions and displaying feedback on performance and outcomes.

### Experiment Design

#### Human Subject Interaction
- **Recruitment**: Participants will form teams and interact with the simulation.
- **Tasks**: Designed to mimic real-world design problems requiring iterative improvements.

#### Data Collection
- **Process Tracking**: Collect data on decision-making processes, changes in strategies, and final outcomes.

#### Metrics
- **Evaluation**: Develop metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of decisions, the efficiency of learning, and the impact of competitive strategies.

### Analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Understand the influence of competition on decision-making and learning behaviors.
- **Model Refinement**: Use the collected data to refine models of Bayesian Optimization and Sequence Learning.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Understanding Competition**: Gain insights into how competition influences design decision-making.
- **Learning and Strategy Adaptation**: Learn how teams adapt their strategies over time in a competitive environment.
- **Tool Development**: Develop computational tools that can predict and enhance decision-making in real-world settings.
